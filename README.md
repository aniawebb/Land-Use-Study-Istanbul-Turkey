# Land Use Study: Istanbul, Turkey
A study conducted via this tutorial: https://gist.github.com/jorisvandenbossche/7b30ed43366a85af8626

The purpose of this project was to practice some spatial analysis by utilizing Python libraries such as GeoPandas. To utilize the libraries and explore their capabilities, Jupyter Notebooks applied to this project from Anaconda. This package manager stores hundreds of open-source packages and provides access to Jupyter Notebooks. Some examples of the spatial analysis conducted include creating histograms, maps, and exploring contents of data tables. One aspect of the data which is analyzed though this project specifically is land use distribution in Istanbul, Turkey. Some examples of types of land use include forests, wetlands, airports, pastures, etc. Here, one land use type is focused on and plotted in a series of geospatial visualizations: green urban areas. Urban green spaces are vital from a health and wellness standpoint, especially in busy cities such as Istanbul. They provide physical benefits by allowing place for exercise, which in turn can lessen the effects of depression, diabetes, cardio-vascular cancer, and more (Lee 2011). Moreover, green spaces have been documented to improve mental functioning and wellness (Wood 2018). For these reasons and more, studying the distribution of current urban green spaces is a relevant and important topic.
